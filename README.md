An exploration of Processing on the web.

#### Staying in touch with Processing

**Twitter**: Follow creative coders and related organizations: John Maeda, Casey Raes, Daniel Shiffman, ProcessingOrg, bitforms gallery (in NYC), Leaders in Software and Art, codedoodl.es, etc. Anyone whose work you like!

**Books**: There is a great list of your options [here](https://processing.org/books/).

**Browse** sites like [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com), Reddit's [/r/creativecoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/creativecoding/) and [/r/processing](https://www.reddit.com/r/processing/), or [OpenProcessing](openprocessing.org) for new creative code projects. Hacker News is only sparsely populated with creative code projects, but the ones that show up there tend to be very goods ones.
